            <i> In different translations of Proclus, the words "manifold" and "multitude" are translated from the same meaning. I might use them interchangeably, know that I'm talking about the same thing. </i>

            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            I've begun reading Proclus' <i>Elements of Theology</i> lately and while I have only gotten through the beginning few Propositions with understanding, those first few are still very powerful. "All manifolds (in my translation, multitudes) participate in the one" is a fascinating proposition, with or without a religious context; the most fascinating is that this idea is so pervasive that you could bend it to pretty much any religion I can think of. The Trinity is to me the most obvious application, but you could say that the Universe, being God's creation, all participates within Him. I'm not very studied on the other Abrahamic religions (or many other religions, unfortunately) but from the vagueties that I know of them it seems this may apply in some way as well.

            Another philosophical axiom that has fascinated me in recent times is probably the most famous syllogism of all: Descartes' "cogito ergo sum." This has fascinated me as I work through my own mental state and my own interpretations of the world prior to my philosophical endeavors. I've always felt a sense of disconnect from reality, partially because I've been "the backup friend" for quite a few years, socially connected but rarely meaningfully so, as well as my seeming lack of some key emotional states (potentially autistic? sociopathic? a personality on the borderline?), and also my noted mental issues with perception of reality and dreams. This one sentence assures me as it assured Descartes, that he is <i>real</i>, <i>present</i>, and actual.
        
            <h2> The Dilemna </h2>
            So I stand here, with two proclamations that I both hold as fundamental observations, and that I both find to be true. Yet, I find them to be conflicting in ways I don't really like. They may seem unrelated, one being a statement about some general theological structure and not really focused on the individual, whereas the other focuses on the deepest doubts of the human mind. But Proclus tells us that everything is interconnected in some way; we see this today all over our world. The vast majority of humanity is connected by not that many links, the systems of global capital are and have been so wildly interconnected that failures in the supply chain of a mineral producer in Africa will have a direct effect on pencil manufacturers on the other side of the world, and an explosion of Mount Etna can reverberate through the Earth and end up closing up a geyser in New Zealand. Each human, and each of their mind, and each thought thought by it, is a multitude as described by Proclus. Thus Descartes, in his thinking, was still participating in <i>the one</i>, as Proclus calls it.

            This raises, to me, some interesting questions; bear in mind I am an underdeveloped philosophical mind, and so perhaps this is a solved problem that I have yet to read on. Descartes knows he is real; he does not yet know the rest of reality is real. Frankly, I run with the supposition that I cannot know the rest of reality is real through our deeply unreliable human senses. Yet if I am real, and I participate in <i>the one</i>, and I
