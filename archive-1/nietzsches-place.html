        <p>
            In my readings of Nietzsche, and recently as I begin to first read Kierkegaard (starting with <i>Either/Or</i>), I've noticed, peculiarly, that Nietzsche seems to be right, at least in his observations. I'm not alone in my recognition; Fr. Seraphim Rose, in the second edition of <i>Death to the World</i>, writes of him as a "mad prophet," of course not in the literal sense of some prophetic successor to the Christ, but prophetic in his telling of the disenchantment of the west, only further evidenced as Protestant Christianity has affirmed its grip on our American psyche.<br/>
            Nietzsche's construction of the "will to power" seems to me to be Nietzsche's paltry replacement for the Lord. For lack of any guidance from on high, Nietzsche takes what it most natural to him &mdash; force; I don't mean to allege Nietzsche was a particularly violent individual, but that what he saw as natural was violence, and violence alone. Every other creature on Earth more powerful than a butterfly seems to engage in it, from mantis to mammal, so it's a reasonable conclusion to come to about what is to be done; if the dogs and cats are violent, and the apes that we seem to be descended from, why not us?<br/>
            This proclivity towards violence is why, I think, Nietzsche despises Christianity so much; Christianity is a distinctly pacifist doctrine, and not only that, but it advocates for <i>more</i> than pacifism; it (in its genuine form) advocates rejection of the world, destruction of one's own form, and to Nietzsche's cynical eye, a reduction of the capability for force in all of us, ie. a weakening. Christianity, in his eye, seeks to destroy all that is natural in destroying our capacity for power, so as to silence our will to power.<br/>
            This is one prong of Nietzsche's analysis which I find to be rather unsurprisingly correct; I don't think his characterizations of the facts are correct. The caustic irony and hateful, spiteful tone he faces Christianity with is obviously unbecoming of a Christian.
