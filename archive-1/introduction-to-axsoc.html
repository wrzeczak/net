            <h2> The Dilemna </h2>
            I have been doing a lot of thinking but I've started to notice a certain lack of philosophy or core within that thinking. I've been moving away from left-anarchism as I realize more and more the impracticalities of anarchism and more towards a kind of light state socialism, not exactly minarchist but certainly not Soviet either. I've begun to read some theory; <i>Socialist Reconstruction</i> by the PSL is pretty good, if not a little optimistic in its tone. I've also begun looking into Kant and Fichte for no other reason other than I saw it on an Internet meme one time. Here in this introduction I will relay what I've cooked up so far about this "axiomatic socialism," that is a kind of socialism based on a set of socialist axioms that I can use to construct politics. I realize this is a not a very Kant way to do this, but I still find it an interesting and potentially very practical thought experiment.
            <br>
            It must be noted that mathematics shows us that axioms, hard-and-fast rules, and logic can only take us so far. In dealing with any human system there must be exceptions, as there are across human nature. The point of this exercise is not a locked-in and complete logic, but a set of guiding principles to govern and construct a socialist society. And let me be clear with my terms; for the beginning part of this article, the word "socialism" means communism, democratic socialism, communalism, left-anarchism, and anything that generally draws from socialism. Later in the article I will define differing axioms, where the different branches of socialism branch from my ideal into otherly-labelled groups. I prefer the term "socialism" for my own thought for reason I will discuss further.

            <h2> The First Axiom </h2>

            What could possibly be the first axiom of a socialist system? I'm not trying to order this list in any particular way but there is still the urge to find something truly fundamental to all socialism. Could it be the assertation of freedom? Sure, but nearly most modern ideologies deify "freedom." The capitalist libertarian idolizes freedom just as well as the democratic socialist, and perhaps even the fascist deludes himself with the idea. No, it is too wide. Is it guaranteeing collective ownership? Maybe, but how does that separate the socialist from the communist, or the communalist? I think the answer is simple; you don't. Such distinctions can be made in due time. As such, I believe the first axiom of socialism (that being, socialism in the general sense of the word, an all-encompassing ideology including communalism and communism as one) is that "<i>the property of the society must be governed collectively and communally, as one</i>."

            <blockquote>
                The property of the society must be governed collectively and communally, as one.
            </blockquote>

            Let us not fret about implementation right now; what does that really mean? Everyone owns everything? Obviously not; many on the left recognize the difference between personal and private property, this is known.
