            I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. You and I both find ourselves entrapped, so to speak. While I am free I do not mean to impose upon your condition, but I will continue my thoughts. I <i>am</i> free, in the sense that the society has chosen to define "freedom." <i>You</i> are free, in the sense that the society has chosen to deem you intolerable. I am free to act but you, <i>you</i> were free to act as you pleased. I don't seek to be an immoral criminal (for some crimes are objectively, moral), but I do seek to be free to act as I please; should they lock me up too? Perhaps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your offense, whatever it was, was somehow intolerable; you were deemed a social malefactor, a leper-in-spirit, and cast off to labor and wallow by our peers. You may feel regret for your crime, or not; perhaps you are truly wrongfully accussed, in which case I deem you a tragic loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            How <i>I</i> deem you, beyond the thoughts of our peer-masses, is to be a soul possessed; in that moment of crime, possessed by rage, by malice, by greed, or by mortal virtue, you malefaction was unlikely to have been thoughtless. As such, you are not in a mental prison (unlike those who crime truly thoughtlessly, they are nowadays deemed insane), but rather a prison against action, a prison that contains only <i>intentions</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Then it must likely be true that your intention is truly imprisoned, that by imprisoning your form our peers have barred you from continuiong to act; whether you intend to revenge, to atone, to reconstructu yourself or flee to a land away, that is truly all you can do -- <i>intend</i>.
        </p>

        <i>unfinished</i>
