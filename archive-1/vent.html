            I miss her. "Her" means two people and I miss each of them in their own way. I dropped Girl M in the worst way possible and every once in a while I think back to just how we cuddled on her bed or in the car and it was just peace. We werer jsut two kids in love next to eac htoehr and I cut it off for no reason. I don't like how I don't really feel bad about it.  i only feel mildly sad and i miss the intimacy and th feeling of peace. it was awful of me to do that to her and i don't feel bad abot it. i destroyed her life for weeks probably and totally idsappeared from her life.
            A still holds me. i miss the purity of our freindship and how i thought we were genuinely friends. she was my losest friend even though i barely knew her if that makes sense. i felt a connection and then she just abandoned me like everyone else. i've seen her twice in the halls now and it's destoryed me every time. i can't bring myself to even say or write her name down because that makes her too real again. i still shee her face all the time, everywhere. she on't leave my mind even though she left my life. i want her back.
            i can't write her name down but it echoes through my brain every day. girl m's name is maggie. she gave me the humnity that i wanted. but also my mental went down the shitter at the same time. i blamed her for it because for some reason i wanted out. it's a perverse kind of attachement issue where i love the relationshiup so much when im with her and then as soon as i leave her house all i can think about is myself and about the other girl. i ruin things for myself i think in order to feel something. i am for some reason unfcomfortable with feeling happy. i have one good girl friend right now and sometimes i feel like i want more intimacy but i know we are friends and she wants it taht way and i want it that way. a girl friend ruins the relationshipo. we are just friends and i can find some other woman to just date and then throw out in am onth when i get bored.
            i hate that i wrote that and it's true. it's not intentional but i do it anyways. i'm just an awful person.

            i miss her.
