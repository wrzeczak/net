        &emsp;I've known the man in the window for a while. I couldn't pinpoint when he first showed up; his presence, a fog in my mind, clouds the time of his arrival. But I feel like I've always felt him behind me, watching me. Sometimes when I see him standing, staring, I get a little scared. A motionless, pitch-black figure, eyeless but still piercing through with a forceful vision. I wonder if he can hear; it's best to assume he can, but he never acts, so does it really matter? <br>
        &emsp;The man outside the window was truly, deeply terrifying the first time I spotted him. I spotted him a second time, and it was similarly so. But repeated exposure therapy has now made me sometimes unconcious of his presence. The aforementioned fog sometimes clouds his very being, such that I don't even notice him staring at me. But I can always feel him if he comes to my mind for the slightest instant; it's a pressure of energy, the feeling of being observed. <br>
        &emsp;I don't know where he comes from; my thought is that he originates from my own mind, but then, I have tried and failed to destroy him, to not see him, but he persists, and I refuse to accept that I do not have complete control over my own mind. He only is through a window; I wonder why that is. When I walk through nature, the man's father's own creation, I can't see him, no matter how hard I look. But I can always feel him behind me; perhaps I can see him through that window into my own soul. The man is always with me, visible or not. <br>
        &emsp;I wrote that sentence that I can never see him under God's light and then a vision unholy struck my mind; him, standing longingly, still staring all the way across the sea to which I venture once weekly. Such things I have never seen, but I can envision the scene so completely that it must be true. This is another example of the man's fog on my mind; what is real, what is a conjuring, and what even is is not known to me, no matter how convicted I am that I have never seen him across that great lake. <br>
        &emsp;The man outside the window, someone I have known for what seems to be all eternity, troubles me so much that it loops back around into comfort. That feeling, of unease, of terror at the thought of him staring at me, reminds me that I still am lucid enough to know I am insane; that thought is the most comforting of all.
