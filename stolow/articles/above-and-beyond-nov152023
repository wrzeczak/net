				Since moving to Jefferson, I've been embroiled with a representative spirit and vigor for governance that I had simply lost in Dixie. The "promise of the frontier," so to speak, called to me. I was so deeply familiar with Jefferson, the beautiful lands which my father and I had been visiting within what would become Jefferson and I had continued to visit after his passing, and the many people I had met along those journeys; yet I still remained a Dixian, on my old farm, and my old home. I moved to Jefferson not only because I wanted a fresh start but because throughout my whole life I had fostered a deep love for the state, its culture, and its people. It is with this love that I plan my political future, not only in the federal House, but at home in the Parliament too.

				I have many plans, and I promise I haven't been holding back on Jeffersonians on the federal level. My commitment to my plans in Washington remain the same, but there are many things that are better left to the states, and here is an opportunity to realize them. I plan to go above and beyond for Jefferson, because that's what Jeffersonians deserve.

				I've made a big deal of rail in this cycle because cheap, consumer rail is something I truly believe in, and something I'm no longer willing to take no for an answer for. As part of the decentralized federal rail model, the states will have to implement complimentary legislation to coordinate resources, potentially allocate funding, and actually do with federal and state money what federal standards-makers have set out to do. Jefferson deserves to have the honor and distinction to be the first state to implement this program, and we are going to do it right; if and when the decentralized federal rail program passes the Congress, I'll be introducing legislation to build it in Jefferson as soon as I can. Jeffersonians deserve cheap, reliable, and broadly-serving consumer rail, and I want to be there to build it for us.

				Next, two things on education. I could speak at length about music education; in fact, I did in the first version of this article, which you can find <a href="https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/articles/old-above-and-beyond-nov152023.txt">the archived text of here.</a> The general gist of what I was trying to say in about a thousand too many characters is this: music education is an incredible tool for students, and is associated in my own personal experience and in many clinical studies with academic and personal achievement. I used the example of state/region of Texas, where I grew up and was a pretty high-achieving bass trombonist in high school. Texas has built a legacy of excellence in this field through decades of funding and administrative support in the middle, high, and collegiate levels of education. I believe it to be a disservice to not build a solid system of music education in that model for our kids, and we have to start now. I also thing modernizing our education system's handling of trade schools in the pre-collegiate level, by building career centers to jump-start the education of kids interested in the trades, is a noble pathway and one I've been looking into for a while now.

				I know only three big ideas looks a little bare; don't worry, I've got a few more coming, but I've got to save something the debate, don't I? I also need time to flesh a few things out, but Jeffersonians can rest assured that over my term in the Parliament, we will be building things for the better, and taking the way forward. Thank you.
