Since moving to Jefferson, I've been embroiled with a representative spirit and vigor for governance that I had simply lost in Dixie. The "promise of the frontier," so to speak, called to me. I was so deeply familiar with Jefferson, the beautiful lands which my father and I had been visiting within what would become Jefferson and I had continued to visit after his passing, and the many people I had met along those journeys; yet I still remained a Dixian, on my old farm, and my old home. I moved to Jefferson not only because I wanted a fresh start but because throughout my whole life I had fostered a deep love for the state, its culture, and its people. It is with this love that I plan my political future, not only in the federal House, but at home in the Parliament too.

I have many plans, and I promise I haven't been holding back on Jeffersonians on the federal level. My commitment to my plans in Washington remain the same, but there are many things that are better left to the states, and here is an opportunity to realize them.

I've made a big deal of rail in this cycle because cheap, consumer rail is something I truly believe in, and something I'm no longer willing to take no for an answer for. As part of the decentralized federal rail model, the states will have to implement complimentary legislation to coordinate resources, potentially allocate funding, and actually do with federal and state money what federal standards-makers have set out to do. Jefferson deserves to have the honor and distinction to be the first state to implement this program, and we are going to do it right; if and when the decentralized federal rail program passes the Congress, I'll be introducing legislation to build it in Jefferson as soon as I can. Jeffersonians deserve cheap, reliable, and broadly-serving consumer rail, and I want to be there to build it for us.

Next, I want to focus on state-level education. We've removed federal control of education, and that's a good thing, and I support that, but that of course means that I need to be in the Parliament to help our kids. So, when I do get into Parliament, I want to implement a couple things. Firstly, we need to build higher-quality facilities for music education in our public schools. Texas is and has been far and away the best state/region for music education in this country; I think we can do better, and what it comes down to is funding and support from administrators at all level, middle, high, and collegiate. Texas has a legacy of excellence because its educators and administrators have been building it and maintaining it for decades; we should start building our own legacy now. Beyond the base inter-state competitive aspect, however, are more concrete reasons for building this. The life-long benefits of music education have been proven a hundred times over, and I can speak from personal experience to back up that research. When I was a kid going through the music education system in Texas, I was a bass trombone player; I still play here and there, where I have time (no, I don't do weddings). I was pretty good, if I do say so myself; I made Texas All-State two times, and I played all through college, though I didn't major in music. My first-hand experience with the Texan music education system taught me not only how to build such a system but what a system does to you once I moved outside of Texas. The kids in my band, and every band in the state of Texas and kids across the country are the high achievers in their school. The valedictorian my sophomore year was our head drum major, and in my senior year many of my friends were automatically admitted to the University of Texas, being in the top 6% of our class of about 950. All those that I could keep contact with have been incredibly successful; frankly, I was the black sheep of the mix, taking up farming and car work, though I'd still consider myself success. Band built friendships, and it taught me a work ethic that I think very few aspects of our school system could; I realize I'm getting long-winded, and that's because of how deeply I feel about this. Long story short, music education is a massive boon to kids, and it'd be a disservice not to build for them a good music education system.

I know only two big ideas looks a little bare; don't worry, I've got a few more coming, but I've got to save something the debate, don't I? I also need time to flesh a few things out, but Jeffersonians can rest assured that over my term in the Parliament, we will be building things for the better, and taking the way forward. Thank you.
