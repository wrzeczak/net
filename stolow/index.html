			<h2>An Introduction.</h2>
			<p>
				Hello. My name is Oliwer Adam Sto&lstrok;&oacute;w. Born and raised in the Texan Panhandle, I'm the son of Polish immigrants and former rhubarb farmer and car mechanic. At the moment I'm currently employed as a Representative for JF-2, and as a small-time web developer maintaining this website for my constituents and all Americans to keep up-to-date with me, my plans, and America's future. Here, I'll be posting updates on my political initatives, my promises to Jeffersonians, and my thoughts on the goings-on of our time. What's too long for Twitter but not warranting of a news organization, basically.
			</p>
			<p>
				To get around, click on any sections below this labelled by month and year. There should be an expanding list of everything I posted to the website that month in that year; you can then click on every title to read the post, and close it again. I think this is a good way to clean up the site, contact my office if you disagree. Keep in mind, this website is designed with Jeffersonians like myself and many others I know who, living in rural areas, don't have great internet. The site is not flashy, it's not-up-to-code with modern web design standards, and that's intentional. I just want a no-nonsense, low-bandwidth place to put things Jeffersonians need to know, and I'm trying my best to make it as accessible as possible. I may or may not also have a soft spot for the internet of the 1990's. Screen readers hopefully should have no trouble with the plain-text methods I'm using, and I know Chrome comes with a Translate function built in which also hopefully should work perfectly. Again, please contact my office if you have any better ideas, thanks.

			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			For those who didn't attend the debate or read a transcript, I've provided a short summary of what I said onstage laying out my plans for this session. Frankly, I probably wouldn't watch an unopposed debate for a House seat if I wasn't politically involved, either.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of, if not the, most important items of my plan is a solution to the problem of cheap consumer rail. The Taylor Administration nobly tried to solve this issue under the RAIL Act, but with mounting legal troubles, let's face it: that's not the solution America needs. I propose a halfway-decentralized system built in the model of the Federal Highway System. The founding principle is this: state ownership, state operation, federal funding, federal standards. Of course there's nuances; the states will likely have to take a share of the cost, and there is the problem of AMTRAK's existence and of their owning some, but not many, rail miles. I'm working out all of these issues with members from the Adala admin, all three state executives, and other political leaders in order to hopefully come to a compromise on this issue that lasts. Expect more soon.
			</p>
			<p>
			I've always been a climate advocate. Serving as Secretary of the Interior for a long time, I handled personally the cleanup of East Palestine via the USF&W, among other projects, and I'm committed to further ensuring the safety of our national environment, <i>especially</i> in the state of Jefferson, home to, if you'll let me be absolute, the most beautiful landscapes in the country, and the world. The problem is that, the federal enforcement machine is big, clunky, and slow. It is a hundred-foot-tall giant wielding a 40-ton hammer; slow, but potentially effective. I move to break down barriers to states, citizens, and citizen groups suing corporations for climate misdeeds in order to allow citizens affected to take rightful action and not have to wait for the giant to bring down the hammer in hopefully the right place.
			</p>
			<p>
			I'd like to continue my work as Interior Secretary advocating for Native groups, as well. Building programs to ensure the maintenance of reservation infrastructure is something I think all of us can get behind to help some of the poorest Americans in the country live the lives they want to live. I also believe in building a strong program for language and cultural preservation. To quote directly from my speech, "it is one thing to lose a land, it is a death of culture to lose a language. Language recording programs serve to the benefit of not only the linguistic academic but also the Shoshone descendant seeking to reconnect with his culture." Linguistic and cultural programs will help preserve the Native way of life that Natives have been fighting so hard to preserve; frankly, it's the least we can do.
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, with growing competition from the Chinese sector and as an extension of my environmental initiatives, I think it's time to being major subsidies for electric vehicle companies in America, but more importantly, it's time to start building more energy into our grid in a safe, clean fashion; I've always said that the path to this is nuclear. Expanding rapidly our nuclear generation capabilites, especially with the recent negotiations for the use of Yucca Mountain, is going to be a much greater boon to our electrifying than anything else.
			</p>
			I'll do my best to keep Jeffersonians and Americans alike updated on these plans, especially the federal rail initiative, as often as I can. Contact my office with any questions or concerns, I'll be happy to take your call. Thank you.

			<button class="month"><h3 class="month-title">Above and Beyond &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; I'm Running for Jefferson's Parliament.</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="month-post-date">Posted November 15, 2023.</span></button>
			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			Since moving to Jefferson, I've been embroiled with a representative spirit and vigor for governance that I had simply lost in Dixie. The "promise of the frontier," so to speak, called to me. I was so deeply familiar with Jefferson, the beautiful lands which my father and I had been visiting within what would become Jefferson and I had continued to visit after his passing, and the many people I had met along those journeys; yet I still remained a Dixian, on my old farm, and my old home. I moved to Jefferson not only because I wanted a fresh start but because throughout my whole life I had fostered a deep love for the state, its culture, and its people. It is with this love that I plan my political future, not only in the federal House, but at home in the Parliament too.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have many plans, and I promise I haven't been holding back on Jeffersonians on the federal level. My commitment to my plans in Washington remain the same, but there are many things that are better left to the states, and here is an opportunity to realize them. I plan to go above and beyond for Jefferson, because that's what Jeffersonians deserve.
			</p>
			<p>
			I've made a big deal of rail in this cycle because cheap, consumer rail is something I truly believe in, and something I'm no longer willing to take no for an answer for. As part of the decentralized federal rail model, the states will have to implement complimentary legislation to coordinate resources, potentially allocate funding, and actually do with federal and state money what federal standards-makers have set out to do. Jefferson deserves to have the honor and distinction to be the first state to implement this program, and we are going to do it right; if and when the decentralized federal rail program passes the Congress, I'll be introducing legislation to build it in Jefferson as soon as I can. Jeffersonians deserve cheap, reliable, and broadly-serving consumer rail, and I want to be there to build it for us.
			</p>
			<p>
			Next, two things on education. I could speak at length about music education; in fact, I did in the first version of this article, which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/articles/old-above-and-beyond-nov152023.txt">the archived text of here.</a> The general gist of what I was trying to say in about a thousand too many characters is this: music education is an incredible tool for students, and is associated in my own personal experience and in many clinical studies with academic and personal achievement. I used the example of state/region of Texas, where I grew up and was a pretty high-achieving bass trombonist in high school. Texas has built a legacy of excellence in this field through decades of funding and administrative support in the middle, high, and collegiate levels of education. I believe it to be a disservice to not build a solid system of music education in that model for our kids, and we have to start now. I also thing modernizing our education system's handling of trade schools in the pre-collegiate level, by building career centers to jump-start the education of kids interested in the trades, is a noble pathway and one I've been looking into for a while now.
			</p>
			<p>
			I know only three big ideas looks a little bare; don't worry, I've got a few more coming, but I've got to save something the debate, don't I? I also need time to flesh a few things out, but Jeffersonians can rest assured that over my term in the Parliament, we will be building things for the better, and taking the way forward. Thank you.

			<button class="month"><h3 class="month-title">My Involvement in the NARC and My Plans Going Forwards.</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="month-post-date">Posted November 18, 2023.</span></button>
			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			A short article; just want to let my constituents and other readers know where we're headed with rail. As the NARC is a closed committee, I can only divulge so much.
			</p>
			<p>
			As you may have seen, I've been included by Pres. Adala in the NARC as a leading voice in the rail debate and representative of Jefferson. While the government continues to pursue privatization, though thwarted in the Senate, I'm still pushing for state-oriented nationalization through advocating for right-of-first-refusal for states on AMTRAK assets in their territory. Essentially, I'm pushing for the federal government to offer AMTRAK assets to states at low or no cost so that they may do with them as they please. This is especially important in the North, where any discontinuation of service on the NEC will affect millions of people, causing job loss and a not-insignificant hit to the Northern economy; given the area served by the NEC connects some of the biggest financial hubs in the world together, it's not unreasonable to assume a hit to the national economy as well. Given the state of passenger rail in this country, I'm not entirely sure if a private option <i>would</i> step in, and if it did, it would undoubtedly rise ticket fares; AMTRAK prices under cost because it's backed by taxpayer funding, spreading the load over 350 million so that the economic hubs of our country can continue to operate smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
			If elected (and frankly, even if not, since there's work to be done on both ends) to JF-1 I still plan to pursue a state-oriented and federally-backed option. We are against a lot, but I'm determined, and Jeffersonians can rest assured that I will keep poking this issue until we can have cheap consumer rail for the whole of our beautiful country.

				<button class="month"><h3 class="month-title">The National Park Reconstruction Act &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; A No-Nonsense Act to Fast Track Reconstruction.</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="month-post-date">Posted November 19, 2023.</span></button>
			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			I've just now proposed the National Park Reconstruction Act on the House floor. This Act appropriates $150 million to the National Park Service, allowing them to fast-track much-needed repairs in the face of increasingly violent weather events,
			</p>
			<p>
			When I was last in Denali, the main road was cut off about halfway due to a large road collapse, and it's slated to cost around $100 million dollars and take years to repair. Later that year, in Big Bend, multiple roads were washed out by storms, blocking off sometimes the only route to many locations within the park. In order to ensure that these repairs can be completed as fast as possible without affecting other NPS operations, we need to inject some funding; the NPS and Secretary of the Interior can investigate more mission-specific organizational consideration on their own.
			</p>
			A permanent link to the bill <a target="_blank" href="https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/files/national-park-reconstruction-act-FINAL.pdf">can be found here</a>. Sections One and Two define the name of the Act and some general terms to make the text of the Act more clear, respectively. Section Three establishes the National Park Reconstruction Fund, a budget item of the NPS. It defines that the fund's purpose will be to be used for reconstruction, and gives example usages &mdash; while leaving room for the discretion of boots-on-the-ground &mdash; and makes some definitions about the way money flows. Part B defines the inital allocation of funds, defines that left-over funds don't need to be spent, hopefully saving us some money, and defines that the Congress shouldn't go below the $150 million dollar inital spending. If the Congress <i>has</i> to change it, the Congress can through an amendment, but federal executives have a habit of slashing programs they don't like to zero and letting Congress just overlook that, and I think this is too important for that. Section Four establishes that this law will override any contradictory laws, and that if one section, part, or item is found unconstitutional, then the rest may stand.
			</p>
			<p>
			Ultimately, it will take a deeper analysis of the NPS and their organizational/management structure to bring even greater efficiencies to reconstruction, but a cash injection allows headroom and goes a long way to ensure that projects will finish on-time, and hopefully some with this influx of funding can be brought forth before that. I truly care about National Parks, that's part of why I was Secretary of the Interior and hopefully will pass confirmation this time around. The best place to make such an organiztional assessment will be from the Desk of the Secretary.
			</p>
			<p>
			As always, my office phone is always open; if you need anything, a more in-depth discussion of this Act, a policy proposal, or anything else, feel welcome to call. I plan to make all bills I propose available in permanent storage here, and to provide a breakdown for every one of them; legalese is a necessity, but not everyone speaks it, and I feel a duty as a Representative is to make sure everyone has the tools to know what's going on. Thank you.

			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			While I intentionally laid low on the website during the Adala scandal, not wishing to bring vitroil forth here, we're past that now. As I said on the House floor, it is time to cast her aside and allow her to impede the Republic no longer. While her conduct is an indictment of the right, especially the old guard establishment that made serious efforts to put her there, that is a discussion for a different time.
			</p>
			<p>
			Part of that reckoning of the establishment right is the resignation of FS Bo following revelations of his <i>severe</i> judicial misconduct. While I lost a tight race to an old friend, and qualified servant, I think it's time to include something new in the Parliament. I'll be be running when the seat for Pres. Bo's seat opens up. It's time for change, and the platform I adopted and will continue to espouse is an opportunity for it. I told voters I wasn't willing to accept no for an answer, and this is only an example of this.

			<button class="month"><h3 class="month-title">Update on Legislation in the Parliament.</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="month-post-date">Posted December 11, 2023</span></button>
			<div class="month-content">
			<p>
			Apologies for the lack of content, it's been a busy few weeks, personally.
			</p>
			<p>
			First off, with my hopeful election to the Parliament, I'm going to working on multiple things, but in particular something I can't work on in the federal sphere. Education was rightly handed down to the states, of course, and I plan to use our own personal purview now to great use for Jeffersonian children and the Jeffersonian leaders of the future. This starts me off with music. When I was a child, growing up in Texas, I had access to some of the best music education facilities in the world, and some of the most robust systems for fostering music education state-wide in the nation and globally. While my band wasn't particularly good, I was a rather good bass trombonist, and the TMEA All-State process, collegiate music infrastructure, and just general love and care for music education found throughout that state allowed me to flourish despite a relatively weak band program located at my middle and high schools. While I didn't study music in college, access to some of the greatest college bands and teachers in the world was certainly a great help, and this all starts with an emphasis at the school-district level on prioritizing funding and teaching for music education. There have been many studies showing kids with music education score higher on standardized tests, perform better generally in school, and all sorts of other benefits; frankly, music is also just fun for kids in a school system that can sometimes (let's be real: often) feel demoralizing, draining, work-like. To focus solely for an hour or two on a beautiful craft is something great, to give kids a break while teaching them a life skill that impacts not just their artistry but their whole life.
			</p>
			<p>
			I tend to ramble about these things. I plan to introduce legislation establishing extensive grant-based funding programs for schools and districts to build music education facilities, acquire instruments, and pay music educators. All this money is frankly designed to draw excellent educators to our great state, and to foster within our state a new generation of music educators and musicians that can start to build the sort of generational musical promise that I found in the state of Texas.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another education policy that I want to extend to our great state is tradesman's training programs in our schools. I've read about recently-established "career centers," and, having visited a couple, I can say I think this a good way forward. Typically, a school district will build one or more "career centers" that hold classes targeted at a specific trade, ie. welding, auto shop work, or even graphic design, or games programming in some places. One school district I visited had multiple, and all those programs I mentioned and many more. What these facilities are designed to do, especially the welding and auto shop classes, I observed, is fast-track a student's career. By giving them novice instruction and, crucically, experience in their field, these facilities allow students to get a head-start on their jobs, and frankly, they need it. In an age where it seems every single job needs an expensive college degree, we need to be building ways to get people who want trade jobs into trade jobs, as free from financial burden as possible, and to ensure that not only do these essential workers continue to be an economic backbone but that they can do it safely, responsibly, and without overhanging financial fears.
			</p>
			<p>
			I'll be proud to work with members Phoenix and Sysadmin towards achieving these goals, and will hopefully have legislation out as soon as possible. Thank you.
