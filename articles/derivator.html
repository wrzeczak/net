        <p>
            Recently, to get back into programming a little, I've decided to apply what I've been learning in Calculus AB through C++ and create a derviator (a program that derives a function). The ultimate goal is to present it a function and to have it apply a bunch of rules and known derivatives (just as I would when solving) to find the derivative of the given function. <br><br>
            My first foray into the subject started with an incredibly simple lexerless and parserless system that only accepted input of <code>Kx^L</code> for K and L between 1 and 9. This then used the power rule to find the derivative <code>KLx^(L-1)</code> through immensely basic means; it simply looked for the caret (<code>^</code>) and found the single-digit positive number next to it, then found the <code>x</code>, found the single digit positive number before it, and did the necessary math. While this worked beautifully (for a very limited set of inputs), the way I programmed it meant that it was not an easily scalable solution. I'm not trying to create Mathway, but I don't want to just implement the power rule. So, I decided I needed to write a lexer and parser, as Mathway and Symbolab sure have, but much less sophisticated. <br><br>
            My current setup for the lexer (the parser, I have yet to get to) is relatively simple. Each significant item (a variable, a number, a caret, etc.) has a "key," which is assigned a value (drawn from an enum, ie. <code>PLUS</code> or <code>NEGATIVE</code>) and a value, which is a string representation of the character in question. Each input string (ie. <code>4x^(-2sin(|x|))</code>) is then parsed into a series of keys, which will then be interpreted by the parser (which I have yet to build). <br><br>
            Currently, the lexer can key every single-character item, like the caret and parentheses. What is more difficult is lexing multi-character items, ie. numbers. My current system is a little difficult to explain, but while writing this I have actually had a revelation as to how simple it really is, so I will detail my thoughts here. Currently, the lexer works on a two-pass system; the first pass captures single-digit characters, and the second pass is meant to be a kind of pre-parser, doing things like discerning between minus and a negative symbol, and also finding multi-character keys. However, I just now realized that I could simply glue them together in the second pass, ie. if the lexer sees 5 <code>NUMBER</code> keys next to each other it can simply tie them together.
