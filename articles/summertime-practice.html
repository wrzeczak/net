            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            I recently published <a id="clickable" href="https://wrzeczak.net/articles/trombone-daily-maintenance">an article</a> covering my daily practice routine for this summer; I've just graduated high school, and while I'm not studying music I will continue playing, and as such I want to improve this summer. <br/>
            My biggest current weak spots are:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Connecting between the deep pedal register (pedal F down), where I have to start shifting, and above that.</li>
                <li>Centering notes in the pedal register and getting a clean start on them, as well as a solid volume from them (everything below Ab comes out but is fuzzy and not loud).</li>
                <li>Articulating cleanly and accurately and quickly (this is probably my biggest weakness).</li>
                <li>A somewhat lacking high range (I can hit high D daily, but can only consistently hit high Bb with good tone, and even then Bb is difficult to start).</li>
            </ol><br/>
            To work on these issues and round out my skillset before heading to college I assembled a maintenance packet which has exercises covering each of these major issues. I'll be uploading semi-regularly this summer with my progress as I work through this.<br/>
            My goals are follows:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Being able to play exercises A and E without any breaking shifts in the pedal range.</li>
                <li>Being able to start every pedal note from Bb to D with the same clarity as any middle-range note, and with appropriately killer volume (LOUD!).</li>
                <li>Being able to single tongue exercises I, J, and K at 120bpm and double tongue at 135bpm (currently at 95 for both).</li>
                <li>Being able to hit double high F without making myself cry, and being able to start a high C with the same clarity as the rest of my high range (Currently can start a Bb somewhat reliably).</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>

            Here are some sound clips of me playing the tonguing exercises.<br/><br/>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="../res/may24-exerciseK.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <span id="right"><br/>Exercise K double-tongued.</span>
            <br/>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="../res/may24-exerciseJ.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <span id="right"><br/>Exercise J double-tongued in F major.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            You can hear me really struggling in exercise K, and that's because this is my biggest weak spot in my playing, ie. double tonguing across valve and partial breaks. Part of it is the way the shape of my mouth changes, which I need to work to minimize, and part of it is simply my lack of familiarity, as a lot of tonguing exercises in middle and high school don't tend to cover that.<br/>
            In the clip of exercise J, I'm trying out two different kinds of double tonguing. In the first pass, I'm tonguing duh-guh-duh-guh, which gives me more consistent results in the low range, while being less firm on the start and more susceptible to flubbing. In the second pass I'm thinking tuh-kuh-tuh-kuh, which is less consistent in the low range (partially because of the distance my tongue has to travel from the tip of my teeth back), but gives a firmer start as I go up, which in many cases is what's desired when doing fast double tonguing.<br/>
            Experimenting with different techniques is crucial to developing as a player; there are probably some cases, like if something is both fast but slurred (I've played some truly <i>awful</i> orchestral transcriptions where a cello/bass part is basically copy-pasted and so you end up with a long slurred line of 16ths at 150bpm), then duh-guh-duh-guh is certianly preferred, but I won't use it as my default because it is less clear and harder to play loudly with. Developing both techniques is crucial to being flexible, which is real mark of skill on any instrument, more so than just being able to go fast. When a conductor asks you to tongue with less or more firmness, you'd better be able to do it!

            <h3>May 31</h3>
            Nothing crazy, there has been some definite progress regarding my consistency than anything else. I've gotten my hands on the bass clef Arban and an excellent guidebook which I will link below.<br/><br/>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="../res/may31-rochut-17.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <span id="right"><br/>First half of Rochut 17, 8vb.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            The iPhone mic really isn't that bad. I obviously need to work on consistency in my legato playing; I'm very often playing glisses (too soft) or playing choppy slurs (too hard). Finding that middle is very difficult on trombone!
