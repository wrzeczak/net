            Here's a pasta recipe I got off Instagram and have been working on for a couple of weeks. It's one-pan, which is really convenient to me now that I've moved into a college dorm.
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>

            The amounts for this recipe are very loose and depend on the amount of pasta you're cooking. If you're going shopping, I'd buy:

            <ul>
                <li>1 bottle of beef or chicken stock, and a bottle of heavy cream (half and half also works, haven't tried with just milk yet).</li>
                <li>A box of pasta (usually, I use half the box when making this recipe.)</li>
                <li>Some parmesean cheese, butter, and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt.</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>

            I'd pre-grate the parm if I were you, this recipe cooks rather slowly so you don't need to do much beforehand other than have everything on hand.

            <br/>
            <h3>Cooking</h3>

            Add olive oil (barely enough to cover the bottom, not too much or it'll destabilize the sauce) to the pan and turn the thing to medium-high heat. If you're only doing half a box, around 5-7 should be good, but if you're doing a whole box in a pot I'd put it closer to 7-8.

            After the oil gets hot, add the dry pasta and toss it around in the oil. Then, add enough stock to cover the pasta and no more than that. We will be cooking the water out so over-adding will only add time.

            <br/>
            When the stock comes to a simmer (if in a pot, not yet a rolling boil), add in a good amount of cream/half-and-half. The sauce will still not be fully constituted yet, don't worry. Mix, and once the cream-stock comes to a simmer, add a healthy amount of butter (half a box, I'd add maybe a tablespoon, for a whole maybe two. The butter will help stabilize the sauce and allow the fluids to mix.)
            
            <br/>
            Once the butter is in and melted, add spices and continue simmering/boiling until the pasta is cooked. While the sauce is cooking, you can add some parmesean, which will help thicken the sauce and add a nice flavor. Careful not to add too much or it'll go the opposite end and get grainy.

            <br/>
            <h3>Serving</h3>

            Dump the results into a bowl. This sauce isn't particularly stable, and will be less so if you added too much olive oil (the oil will simply fall out of the solution and pool at the bottom of the bowl, it'll taste just fine).
