            The following is a compilation of all the notes I took on St. Augustine's Confessions. My note-taking method is pretty simple. While reading (for this first assignment, I read Books I, II, and III), I take notes on sticky notes and stick them next to the specific passage/quote I'm referencing. Once I'm done reading my section, I take out (almost) all of the sticky notes, type them up into Obsidian, then leave the stack in a safe place.<br/>
            The Obsidian document can be found <a href="https://wrzeczak.net/res/st-augustine-confessions-obsidian.md">here</a>. I've also HTML-ized the document, which is readable here below.<br/><br/>

            <i>FYI: "Double quoted" words are direct quotations from the text; 'single quoted' words are my own figurative quotation marks. Within a quotation, [boxed] words are me adjusting the citation grammatically. Outside a quotation, they are me clarifying my meaning and writing something that I didn't put on the physical sticky note. Italicized words are my own emphasis being added. A Roman numeral or a number preceding a note is me referencing the paragraph number (which are numbered in two systems for unknown to me reasons) which my edition contains. A page number is me referencing on which page the material is in my edition. I am reading the Oxford World's Classics edition, trans. Henry Chadwick, ISBN 970-0-19-953782-2.</i><br/><br/>
            <br><strong>Book I</strong><br>
            ii. Existence [would not be?] a property of man and all Creation if the Lord were not in it. If we did not participate in the <em>divine energies</em>, we would not <em>be</em>; "I would have no being if I were not in you." Augustine here describes <em>theosis</em>.<br>
            iii. "what you will fill you fill by containing it." Existence, <em>definite</em> existence, is a product of God's will. Definition does not contain God, but rather His definition <em>of us</em> is our participation in Him.<br>
            v. "If I do not love you, is that not a little misery?" This is precisely the nature of [omitted for obvious incorrectness] and Hell. God is omnipresent, and so those wicked condemned to punishment 'bask' [for lack of a better word...] in the glory of the lord, but to them it is a horrible sight.<br>
            6. This again is a clear pronunciation of the doctrine of theosis. The Lord "enhances our soul" to mimic Him, and we do not argue, but fully align our will with God's; as Kierkegaard said we are always wrong before God.<br>
            vi. He seems to harp on an ascetic tendency here; yes, good things come of the flesh, when we don't "wise for more than [we are] given." But the essence of 'goodness' is not the satisfaction of our needs in moderation, it is <em>salvation</em>, which we achieve in spirit, in heart, and in flesh.<br>
            pg. 8. We know from St. Maximus that we do not have pre-existent souls, and perhaps St. Augustine shows us in part why -- "They would have no way of passing away if you did not set a limit on them" -- Would they have any way of beginning if they did not have that limit set on them? [This is a bad argument, and not what the Saint is arguing at all; pre-existence of souls still implies created souls, maybe outside of time and space, but created nonetheless and therefore with a beginning].<br>
            pg. 8. "So too let him rejoice and delight in finding you who are beyond discovery rather than fail to find you by supposing you to be discoverable."<br>
            x. Obviously, God is still the Creator, but in this the Saint wishes to show perhaps that God created pure man, <em>in</em> His image, but he did not create sin (which has no existence), and therefore when we become sinners, we die, we deny ourselves existence, we un-create ourselves against the will of the Lord.<br>
            18. The Saint here seeks to correct a deferred baptism (not necessarily a 'believer's baptism' [as found in modern Protestantism]). He shows that it can promote a faulty concept of life in the Church, which truly is a <em>healing</em> process. People should be baptized early so that they are invited into the hospital and allowed to <em>begin</em> healing.<br>
            xii. "No one is doing right if he is acting against his will, even when what he is doing is good." The pronoun there is not referring to the Lord [, rather, to the actor], but I think it can. Goodness comes from alignment with the Lord's will, not from some inherent quality of the act.<br>
            xii. "and so it is that the punishment of every disordered mind is its own disorder."<br>
            22. "It is true, veils hang at the entrances to the schools of literature; but they do not signify the prestige of the elite teaching so much as the covering up of error."<br>
            xiv. The freedom of thought, of will, that is bestowed upon us, is not a freedom to think whatever, to do whatever; rather it is the <em>freedom</em> to come to Christ, it is the freedom to <em>learn</em>, to <em>know God</em>. This is not imposed, it is simply [what is means for] <em>human nature</em> [to be free].<br>
            xviii. "To be far from your face is to be in the darkness of passion." This exactly is the nature of sin. It has no positive existence, no purveyor [as in, no creator], no substance. It is simply a shutting of the eyes. It is <em>movement</em> away from the Lord, for "no one, in the last analysis, serves Satan against his own will." (St. Seraphim Rose, <em>Nihilism, the Root of the Revolution of the Modern Age</em>).<br>
            29. The Saint reminds us that <em>hate</em> is not a Christian doctrine, but rather that it is the religion of <em>love</em>. To misunderstand this core message and truth of the Gospel is worse than to suffer for <em>pronouncing it</em> (Protestant textualists...).
            <br><br><strong>Book II</strong><br>
            4. "You bring death upon us so that we may not die apart from you." This is a primary message of the OT. All of the Law [of the Old Covenant] was instituted to bring men to a state of repentance. Once men had been able to [repent], God came to [further] bring man to Him. "Acquire the Spirit of Peace, and thousands around you will be saved" (St. Seraphim of Sarov). First, men had to be taught to acquire the Spirit of Peace, and only then could they spread salvation.<br>
            8. "The invisible enemy trampled on me and seduced me because I was in the mood to be seduced;" "No one, in the last analysis, serves Satan against his will" (St. Seraphim Rose).<br>
            iv. Exodus 20:15 is the commandment "You shall not steal." An actual punishment for thieving can be found in Exodus 21:37-22:1.<br>
            v. Yet again the Saint expounds the nature of Christian asceticism. We are not a death cult, <em>hating</em> our bodies and wishing the would wither. Rather, we recognize the limitation of our flesh and our world. We know good can [come] from the world, but only insofar as God defines it, for He is the ultimate good. [Thusly, the ascetic is not trying to kill himself, but only live on what he needs, which for a holy man is very, very little other than the nourishment the Lord Himself provides by grace].<br>
            vi. "There as nothing beautiful about you, my thieving. Indeed to do you exist at all for me to be addressing you?" The Saint questions whether his crime still 'exists' [or maybe even ever existed] in the same frame of mind as his previous discussion of existence [, because obviously, it happened; that's not what he's questioning]. if there is truly "<em>nothing</em> beautiful" to it, then God did not create it, and it [therefore] does not exist. Its barrenness, emptiness, is a product of [it being sin].<br>
            14. "They put themselves at a distance from you and exalt themselves against you. But even by this imitating you they acknowledge that you are the Creator of all nature and so concede <em>there is no place where one can entirely escape from you</em>" [emphasis added]. [In my experience,] the atheist obsesses over God just as much as us.
            <br><br><strong>Book III</strong><br>
            3. "Therefore some kind of suffering is <em>commendable</em>, but none is <em>lovable</em>." This is coming from a bishop, i.e. a <em>monk</em>; who 'suffers' more for [the faith] than he, except the martyrs and the passion-bearers? The answer is that the monk does not 'suffer' in the way the Saint describes it [, though St. Seraphim Rose describes our faith as a "suffering" one; this is not what St. Augustine is necessarily talking about]. "No suffering <em>injures</em> [God]," and neither does it the deified monk. ['Suffering,' in its common negative connotation, is not what St. Augustine is talking about; how can a monk in the process of theosis, of becoming like God, 'suffer,' if the Lord does not?]<br>
            13. 'Why do we no longer follow the Law of the Jews?' Because those rules had a time and place; they were meant to bring a specific people in a specific time to a state of repentance so that all men could , by their [the Jews'] virtue, come to receive the New Covenant [return again to St. Seraphim of Sarov]. This is clear throughout <em>both</em> testaments.<br>
            The ball (God's moral truth) is unchanging; we fickle, timely creatures, change what we see of God's law b virtue of His will - "Yet it is not given all at once."<br>
            xi. What is worse than death? To be dead and still live, perhaps.</p>
