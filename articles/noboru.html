            <i>This essay was written as part of a larger grouping for a semester final writing project. It deals with the topic of suicide and my personal opinions of it, making heavy reference to the works of Yukio Mishima. The writing is offensively, unreadably dramatic and the development of the notion of "opposed dualities" or "oppositional dualisms" is contrived here, as it is more thoroughly fleshed out in other parts of the broader scheme. I think ultimately that this essay can stand alone, though, and so I've left it here.</i>

            Suicide and its glorification is the most <i>unpitiable</i> hallmark of modernity. The observation of Camus that it is the admission that life is too much for oneself is itself evidence enough, and I have always been personally repulsed by the notion. As someone whose thoughts are wrapped in his own death, suicide is a daily temptation of mine, but as of late I have still yet to commit myself to the act; for one cannot die without disfiguring his own face, not only in the consideration of the method but in the consideration of the fact that I am not a saint, and thus my death mask will not be kissed with a smile and will likely become incontinent, and unpitiable. We should maintain at all times the principles that our faces are ones only our mothers could love, and in the recognition of that fact, we cannot put ourselves in such a repugnant state where even she would turn away in disgust.

            But the some of the glorifiers of the act try to wrap themselves in the powerful imagery of death, as if suicide has anything to do with death at all. They look at themselves and, recognizing that every autobiography is left incomplete, that living “is the total form of life minus <i>alpha</i>,” claim that to bring about one's own death – death which is “the highest expression of the living” – is taking control over one's life, taking control over death, and becoming God Himself. This is an utterly ridiculous claim; suicide cannot be the fullest expression of life, the utter disclosure of life itself – death – and the simultaneous admission that life is too much for you; do you want more of it? Suicide well and truly <i>has very little to do with death</i>; it is an ignoble cry for help, a delusional plunge into the Fountain of Life, for the suicidal man wishes not to die but for life to become easier, more tolerable, more to his fancy. Such a ridiculous man cannot claim the aesthetic of death just as much as a deserting soldier cannot return and "claim the honor" of his service.

            Others still, glorifying the act in a similar vein, call it so easy to fall into, almost natural to some us (who they look on with scorn for their illness); they run about this campus and everywhere young people gather, infecting them with this vicious lie. This lie pushes them into disrepair, unhealthiness, as far as all healthy men consider their own suicide. They do this again to liken suicide with death, and as far as they correctly observe death to be so easy to fall into, they call suicide an easy way to die; for death <i>is</i> easy to come by. Every step a man makes is an existential decision; would it not be safer for him to stand still, and not risk a slip? For this very reason it surrounds us, consumes, and insists upon itself. Suicide does no such thing! It is a profoundly unnatural act, requiring a contrivance of the circumstances of one's own death. How many deaths per year are accidental, and how many suicides? The obvious divergence of that pattern alone is evidence enough. The accidental character of death is what gives it existential power, as an unstoppable force, and yet the claim is sought that suicide, one of the few acts that is truly, positively willed alone, is related in any way to death? So are the glorifiers exposed.

            Note the failure of oppositional dualisms; in the face of rising suicide deaths from cults and from artistic glorification of the act,  a movement was concocted to pre-fill the brains of children with what I call “anti-glorification” rhetoric (this is the latter camp described above); but it seems as if in reality that the polar opposite of a glorification is still in essence a glorification, just as much as antimatter and matter are essentially identical. This oppositional dualism, of glorification and anti-glorification, must be escaped, and it cannot be done, as the glorifiers and anti-glorifiers have done, by harping on the emotional quality of suicide (that which is common to both of them); the positive glorifiers wrap themselves in the awesome air of death, the prime subject of all art, and bathing themselves in blood, attempt to make themselves a final artistic statement. In reality, they tend to just look red and black. The anti-glorifiers, noting the power of death imagery (of artistic imagery in general, all of it being directed towards death in its disclosure), wish to make it something unspeakable,  solemn; they ask you for your remembrance, your <i>pity</i>, as if this is not a glorification in itself, goading on those inclined towards suicide and towards dramatisms to committing the act. As someone who is more than most people inclined towards dramatic thinking (and obscenely dramatic writing), I speak here from experience.

            In reality, the emotional character of suicide is quite flaccid. It is a rushing towards death, a <i>self-excitation</i> that in its imitation of death lacks force and fails to live up to the fullness of the real act. The primary example is found in the greatest suicide of all, that of Yukio Mishima. Mishima's suicide is incredibly compelling, and in the West it is by far the most famous thing he ever did. To find out why, we can investigate the second-most famous thing Mishima ever did – masturbate to the image of the death of St. Sebastian.  Mishima's life was one soaked in sexual gratification, and so it is immediately clear why his suicide is the most authentic – because Mishima was not afraid to disclose the <i>masturbatory</i> character of suicide; in rushing towards death, in self-excitation, and in lacking in vitality it matches masturbation in kind. It is through this recognition that we can discover the real emotional character of suicide; suicide is a grave social secret not to be spoken of not because of a genuine emotional weightiness to the matter, but for the same reason that masturbation is not spoken of! Does the debate over the banning of pornography hold the same pithy, wailing quality that emotional discourse over suicide does? No! That notion is imposed onto it. And so just as much as a mother finding her son in masturbation cries out – “My own son, a filthy, disgusting thing like that – I could die this very minute!” – so too does she wither away in disgust at his death mask, unless perhaps he is a saint. The order of things being preserved, death takes her in its natural course before her son, and she never defaces their relationship by the observation of his corpse. But the suicidal man makes a mockery of himself in his offense to the order of things, and forces his mother to cast her eyes in revulsion upon him. This offense to her is what makes the act of suicide <i>unpitiable</i>.
