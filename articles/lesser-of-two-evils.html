            Often in American politics is the Presidential election presented as a choice between "the lesser of two evils." Many Americans recognize that the figureheads of both parties, and the parties themselves, are increasingly incapable of serving Americans' interests, and in fact are judged by many to be evil. However, many of these Americans, typically in my experience on the Democratic side of the discussion, justify their continued votes for their side by making the moral claim that it is moral to, in a situation where one is presented with the lesser of two evils, to vote for the less evil candidate.
            <br/><br/>
            I disagree with this contention. I think that if you recognize that the candidate you are voting for is evil, then it is evil to support them regardless of how evil any other given candidate is.
            <br/><br/>
            To prove this, I will begin with the contention that an action is termed "good" if it is morally good to perform that action; this is a tautology, and I think non-controversial. Additionally, I claim that an action is called "evil" if it is morally evil to perform that action, by the same construction as before. I contend that good and evil are opposites of each other, that evil is not-good, and thusly by the definitions of good and evil it is not-good to perform an evil action. I do not think this is particularly controversial. To contend otherwise would muddle the definitions of good and evil such that they are no longer opposites and doubtfully seperable from each other; it would perhaps require the insertion of a third moral category, or the abandonment of the real distinction between good and evil as real moral constructions. In either case, one would not apply the logic of a "lesser evil" to a moral problem, since there would be much simpler alternatives to making a judgement on who to vote for.
            <br/><br/>
            I have already made the conception of "good" and "evil" analogous to the logical construction of "true" and "false." It is not necessarily incoherent to make the claim that something could be less evil than another evil thing; obviously, some sins are greater than others. However, if we are going to rigorously structure our conceptions of good and evil as opposites, then we can only apply a logical calculus to them. Thusly, the concepts of the magnitudes of good and evil are discarded. This does not make this system impractical. Surely, one would still assert that it is always morally preferable to do a minutely good thing over any evil thing. The magnitude of goodness and evilness do not apply in broad decision-making, and are only relevant concepts when we are in a situtation where we must choose between two actions of the same moral character, and <i>only</i> those two options. 
            <br/><br/>
            Succintly put, if we take the principle that we should always choose the morally "best" option, then in all cases where there are any number of morally good options, and any number of morally evil options, one would always choose one of the morally good options. To decide between which action to take within the set of evil options or good options, one would have to follow a course of action unguided by the constraints of this absolutely dual construction, but by something else, perhaps the guidance of one's conscience.
            <br/><br/>
            Let us now evaluate whether it is moral to vote for a candidate which is the lesser of two evils. Because of the way this subject is often treated in discourse, and indeed because of the way the subject is treated on the ballot, it is often tacitly assumed that we must choose between either A, voting for candidate 1, or B, voting for candidate 2. If it is morally good to vote for one candidate, and not the other, then the choice is obvious. However, if we recognize that both options A and B are morally evil (if it is evil to support evil, and voting is in some way meaningfully supportive of and evil candidate, it is evil to vote for that candidate), then it seems our abstraction has abandoned us, and we are forced to partake a morally evil action. But this is not true; there are multiple other options, such as C, not voting, or D, voting for an alternative candidate, potentially even yourself.
            <br/><br/>
            Simply put, the problem is a false di-lemma. There are more than two options, and the other options are potentially morally good. If it would be morally good to vote for the candidate in D, then the choice is obvious; we should always choose good over evil, even if the candidate is unlikely to win, or if the candidate is yourself. Case C is evidently doing not-evil i.e. good by not doing an evil action.
            <br/><br/>
            By this moral calculus, then, it is not good to choose the lesser of two evils. It is not good to do evil, to support evil, to vote for evil. It is not-not-good, or good, to not vote for evil.
