            Made the fullest realization of what I've known for months; I don't know if I've ever really loved a woman, and I don't know if I even know what it feels like to be loved by a woman. I think all of my female escapades have been driven by my profound mental illness. I *want* these women but only in the literal sense; I want their essence, I want what makes them them. I want womanhood, the female form, and I draw myself to whosoever looks like Ava because I want to be Ava. It's despicable. It's why I grovel instead of loving myself and her as an extension of a holy union. It's despicable.
            As I've gotten more comfortable I've started falling more and more back into old habits. It's not good.
            <br/><br/>
            At the same time, I could never settle for a transition. I'd never feel like Ava because I'd never be Ava. It'd always be me, dancing in femininity but only if I close my eyes.
            <br/><br/>
            But maybe it's true that I have absolutely no idea that I'm afraid. My band practice was threatened with cancellation; I was somewhat happy, as much as I love it it's really hard and I need a break. I stepped out of the parking garage and saw the rain had stopped, and the clouds had drifted. I was sad a little, but then I looked at the sky and thought that I should never be sad to see the sun.

            (responding to "me personally i'd just say be trans i guess but that's not really an option for you")
            <br/>
            not doing that <br/>
            to be frank the thought repulses me <br/>
            not because i hate trans people or whatever but because of my a) internalized homophobia and b) constant feeling that i'm an imitator <br/>
            idgaf about what trans people are doing nor do i think they are fakers and not real gender-wise <br/>
            i believe what they say about themselves - who am i to doubt them? i could just never believe the same <br/>
            i've tried for a while though i've not gone through a social or medical transition <br/>
            to just get in the head space <br/>
            it never ends well <br/>

            i think me trying to dress up like a girl and go around being called she would end very poorly <br/>
            because my desire isn't really for that it's for just internal acceptance of my own condition <br/>
            and that can one of two ways and the first one hasn't worked so far so i'm trying to second one <br/>
            it works for the trans people, clearly, and good for them <br/>
            i believe them when they say it works for them <br/>
            but i'm only concerned with myself at the moment <br/>
            <br/>
            i've gone around on internet circles before pretending to be a girl <br/>
            taking a fake name and using she/her and what not <br/>
            initially there was a sense of profound calm to it <br/>
            but i kept doing it and realized that i was just deluding myself <br/>
            i'd stay up all night thinking about it and it'd just get worse and worse over time <br/>
            playing into it made me want to rope more than anything <br/>
            so i'm not going down that path again <br/>

            “I came to Carthage and all around me hissed a cauldron of illicit loves. As yet I had never been in love and I longed to love; and from a subconscious poverty of mind I hated the thought of being less inwardly destitute. I sought an object for my love; I was in love with love, and I hated safety and a path free of snares. My hunger was internal, deprived of inward food, that is of you yourself, my God. But that was not the kind of hunger I felt. I was without any desire for incorruptible nourishment, not because I was replete with it, but the emptier I was, the more unappetizing such food became. So my soul was in rotten health. In an ulcerous condition it thrust itself to outward things, miserably avid to be scratched by contact with the world of the senses. Yet physical things had no soul. Love lay outside their range. To me it was sweet to love and to be loved, the more so if I could also enjoy the body of the beloved. I therefore polluted the spring water of friendship with the filth of concupiscence. I muddied its clear stream by the hell of lust, and yet, though foul and immoral, in my excessive vanity, I used to carry on in the manner of an elegant man about town. I rushed headlong into love, by which I was longing to be captured. 'My God, my mercy' in your goodness you mixed in much vinegar with that sweetness. My love was returned and in secret I attained the joy that enchains. I was glad to be in bondage, tied with troublesome chains, with the result that I was flogged with the red-hot iron rods of jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.”
            <br/><br/>
            "But at the time, poor thing that I was, I loved to suffer and sought out occasions for such suffering. SO when an actor on stage gave a fictional imitation of someone else's misfortunes, I was the more pleased; and the more vehement the attraction for me, the more the actor compelled my tears to flow."<br/>
            all this girl-larp with my music and my internet activites, and for what? i seek out occasions for such suffering. the more these actors compel my tears to flow, though i can't even bring myself to be so sincere as to do that. the last time i cried, other than when Y left me, was like 3 years ago. this folly of mine is so powerfully dead that i can't even do that, no matter how hard i try. "Hence came my love for sufferings, but not of a kind that pierced me very deeply." none of this is even real (in the augustinian verbiage, for my sin has no positive existence), and yet it still tormnets me. nobody serves Satan against his own will.
