        <p>
            For a long time, from my senior year of high school through to now (my first semester of college) I've in my study of philosophy also made an effort to study Christian theology; specifically, I focused on Eastern Orthodoxy, as that was the theological system that I thought had the most potential for coherence. I was raised in a lukewarmly Catholic environment, my father a believer though his church attendance stopped around 2020, and my mother an honest but not particularly argumentative atheist. I was prompted to begin studying Christianity by <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, and pretty quickly found many problems with Catholicism, particularly the infallibility of the Pope and the seeming variability of Catholic doctrine throughout history. This start led me pretty quickly to Orthodoxy, which held my interest because of its potential to solve the problems of Catholicism and a few others which were of my concern.<br/><br/>
            In the internet sphere, Orthodoxy's vanguard is Jay Dyer and his cohort of debate-minded content creators. Their focus is on <i>argumentation</i>, not faith because most of them are not priests and therefore consider matters of the faithful life beyond their scope as, learned as they are, non-clergy. This is a pretty sensical strategy, after all. Oftentimes in dialogue with Christian thought, people are very eager to get to first principles, and the justification for God's existence is a primary topic of conversation as a result. Dyer and company focus ultimately on argumentation that justifies the Orthodox God, and in doing so create content not only in live debate with all manner of people but also lecture-adjacent content focusing on theological specifics in Christian and non-Christian traditions. This was immediately appealing to me; I'd often heard it said that belief in God was simply unjustifiable, that "you can't prove it and you can't disprove it." This always bothered me, for I thought that surely nobody would go on with this for two-thousand years without some pretty strong evidence or argumentation for their belief? Surely it was not just a question of faith, choice to believe?<br/><br/>
            In a sense I was right, as Dyer did his best to present; the decision to believe in God is, in one sense, a completely logical, rational, faithless decision. Dyer and company propagate the "transcendental argument," which claims that metaphysical reality is clearly observed, and that only the Orthodox Christian God can justify all that we observe in metaphysics, and that therefore God exists. Now, I thought, I had a strong justification for belief in God. The merits of the transcendental argument are, in hindsight, dubitable, mostly because it is rarely stated with detailed <i>positive</i> argumentation, and is typically given in a <i>negative</i> form, as in "your system cannot account for this," instead of "my system can account for this, and here's exactly how." One also wonders why we need a justification in the first place, if metaphysics is so clearly observed to people. However shaky the argument was, however, I thought myself a believer.<br/><br/>
            From here on, I involved myself heavily in the study of theology. At about the same time, my girlfriend left me, leaving me in an expectedly ravaged state. For a long time in high school, I had been barren of social contact outside of the school day, and she was more or less my only friend in terms of real-life (or even digital, really) contact among my non-internet friend groups; I was not comparably attached to those friends on the internet, anyways. The study of theology was perhaps an outlet for my grief in that loss, a loss which I am still working through myself; I loved her in a way that I felt Dostoyevsky could only describe, and himself being a man of Orthodox faith, his example was one I perhaps wished to follow. I had heard that "God is Love," and I feel that perhaps I was trying to replace the void she had left in my heart with the Lord. In light of this, the claim that Christian life is without faith already seems entirely nonsensical.<br/><br/>  
            I read books and consumed lecture content on Orthodox theology voraciously. I have not updated the <a href="https://wrzeczak.net/bookshelf.html" id="clickable">Bookshelf</a> in a long time, but it can list the large amount of theological texts I consumed, and at time of writing it is missing a few books. I learned more and more about the history of the faith, and the Christology, which is the root of Orthodox theology from which all things flow. I engaged in a lot of internet discussion about the topic in mostly critical circles, and felt myself a competent defender of my beliefs. But all this time, I still could not compel myself to go to a Liturgy. Every prayer I uttered felt entirely empty, and I did not involve myself in a strong prayer rule. In short, my actual life changed very very little.<br/><br/>
            At this point, especially after coming to college (which I had promised myself would be the beginning of my conversion), I came to realize myself a hypocrite. Nobody chose to accuse me of this, as in public debate (as in, dorm discussions, oftentimes in the lobby or lounges, not Cliff-style evangelism) with my friends and peers in college I was very strongly convicted and unrelenting in my viewpoint. Out of kindness towards me they chose to take me at my word, and in some sense I wasn't necessarily lying. I did believe what I said, after all, that God existed and he must exist for these reasons, and in expositing the details of the Orthodox faith I considered myself well-learned (for a novice 18-year-old) and genuine in my approach, if not always correct; others are far kinder to my own intolerable bullshit than I was myself, and I felt more and more that I needed to resolve the crisis of my own hypocrisy soon.<br/><br/>
            It was at this point that I began and finished <i>Forbidden Colors</i> by Yukio Mishima. Barring any discussion of the content of this book (it is now my favorite), what it did at the very least for me was offer something new, something to hold onto in the murky waters, and allowed me to surface what it seemed I had always believed about myself, that I <i>simply had no reason to be good</i>. I had never felt guilt for any sin due to its sinfulness, the Christian moral code never had had a grip on me beyond the hypothetical discussion. This had been true for a long time, if not my whole life, but I had been reluctant to think about it, or to put it into words. At the very least, it makes you sound like a total edgelord to say something as stupid as "why should we be good?" I don't intend to be an edgelord, but simply want to demonstrate my own faithlessness in life. As far as I believed in God, and knew God exists, I believed without faith, and that was a critical error. Failing to engender faith within myself, I finally decided to cast aside any claim to being "Christian;" I had in my time been embarrased to do so not because it was a hostile environment to Christians, rather the opposite; I met some people with genuine Christian faith, and I felt ridiculous wishing to compare myself to them at all, virtuous and happy and coherent as they were. The life of faith seems far above me, and I felt myself an imitator in the presence of those who had felt the light of God's grace.<br/><br/>
            This is the cause for my recent move away from Christianity; it's nothing particularly profound (it's honestly quite stupid, actually), and though it seems to some radical, especially my college friends who I introduced myself to as a Christian, it is really nothing but an admission that I was trying to play a game I'm not cut out for.<br/><br/>
            I wished to engender into myself faith through time spent with the material. I had dated multiple girls by this approach in high school, saying "I don't think I love her, but maybe that'll come." I knew this to be a horrific strategy, and had proclaimed myself a lover, and loved strongly from a moment's thought my now ex-girlfriend, but fool that I was I failed to apply this sober principle to any other facet in my life. God simply was not there, hard as I tried to summon faith through learning and embroilment, and the mechanism is much the same, as far as "God is Love."<br/><br/>
            I don't mean to make this some sort of announcement, as if anyone particularly gives a shit, or anything unique. As with all content on this site, it's more a book-depository of thoughts, perhaps done with the hope that someone will climb up and fire a shot.<br/><br/>
