            This is a short piece in which I will go over what I mean by "definition in opposition," as well as provide some relevant cultural examples. I will probably cite this article in future writings so I don't need to explain this term and its importance in future, so I believe this to be a pretty important read.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To begin, I will define "definition in opposition." To define something in opposition is to define it as opposing something else. That is, if I wanted to define A, I could describe what makes A a distinct concept, or I could describe it as <i>not</i> B. Describing A as <i>not</i> B, and making that a core part of A's definition or identity, is what definition in opposition means. This much is relatively self-explanatory, but it is important to note that there is a differnce between saying "A has characteristics X and Y, which are different from B's W and Z" and saying "A has X and Y <i>because</i> B has W and Z, and X and Y are <i>not</i> Z."

            <b>Contrasting Characteristics</b><br/>
            <code>
                A -> X, Y due to some reason --- B -> W, Z due to a different reason<br/>
                X, Y oppose W, Z -> A and B are opposed
            </code><br/>
            <b>Definition in Opposition</b><br/>
            <code>
                B -> W, Z due to some reason --- A -> X, Y because B has W, Z<br/>
                X, Y oppose W, Z -> A and B are opposed
            </code><br/>
        </p>

            To give a perhaps more understandable example (to my presumably American audience), consider the American Democrats and Republicans. If the Republicans adopted the policy that all ducks should be painted pink, due to their ideology, and the Democrats wanted all ducks to be instead painted yellow, due to their own ideology, then they would simply have constrasting/opposing viewpoints. However, if the Democrats wanted all ducks to be yellow <i>because</i> the Republicans want them pink, and the Democrats don't want anything the Republicans want, then the Democrats would be defining themselves in opposition to the Republicans.

            This concept is extremely relevant to matters I want to write about, too. A lot of Polish identity on the world stage and within the country is defined in opposition to Russia (or more generally, eastwards). This may be because in that particular area, Poland struggles to emphasize its national identity, or it needs to appear strongly European, and not Russian. Polish culture wants to exist in the mid-zone, between Europe and Russia, by strongly maintaing Polish Slavic culture, language, tradition, etc. but also drawing a firm line between it and Russia.

            Before I get to any large examples, let me start with something very specific which will show you how deep this definition in opposition to Russia goes. My paternal grandparents own a small plot of land (less than an acre) in the Pomeranian countryside, a few hours drive from Gdańsk. One day, when I was 16, I was reading something about Trotsky and Stalin and came across the word <i>dacha</i> (Russian: <i>дача</i>, Polish: <i>dacza</i>). After researching the word, I learned it means a "country house," or something like the American rich family's summer home in the mountains. So, being the enterprising young student of Polish I was, I wondered if this Russian word дача meant the same thing in Polish. When I asked my parents, I was surprised to find that <b>no</b>, dacza has a very different meaning in Polish. While my father gave me some literal meaning about how people in Polish would refer more to the land and not the house itself, what I really grabbed onto was that Polish people don't call it dacza because дача is a Russian concept, not a Polish one. Calling it what a Russian would call it Russifies you and your beautiful summer home, and so the word is not used. This definition in opposition in even minute details of the language demonstrates the extent to which this permeates Polish thought. Other linguistic example is given by Timothy Snyder in his relatively well-known Yale lecture series about <a href="https://youtu.be/Om_A5TTQMm0?t=298">the history of Ukraine</a>. Very recently, with the beginning of the most recent Russian offensive into Ukraine, the English-speaking world has switched from calling the capital of Ukraine Kiev (the Russian spelling) to Kyiv (the Ukranian spelling), from Lwów (Polish) to Lviv (Ukranian), and so forth. The sudden switch from the use of Russian to the use of Ukranian is a concious effort to assert Ukranian identity by defining Ukraine as <i>not Russia</i>. By calling it Kyiv, and not Kiev, you assert through a simple spelling shift that Kiev (and the rest of Ukraine) is <i>Ukraine</i>, not Russia.
        </p>

            This concept has larger cultural ramifications as well. For instance, Poland is Roman Catholic, while Russia is (generally) Orthodox, and Germany is Protestant. The circumstances for this arrangement arose hundreds of years ago, but this religious status quo is maintained (and has been maintained) in part <i>because</i> Poland does not want to practice a Russian (or German, for that matter) religion. Just as the Americans said during the Red Scare that "because the USSR is atheist, we must be Christian," and then added "under God" to the pledge, the Poles have been saying (for much longer) that "the Russians are Orthodox, and we shall not be Russian." Poland's independent fervor and need for seperation from Russia stems from hundreds of years of attempted Russian assimilation (Russification) of Poland.
        </p>

        <p>
            To close, I just want to reiterate that this is a foundational element of Polish cultural thought. Modern Poland would be much less characteristically (to its benefit or not) Polish without this seperation between Poland, Russia, Germany, and everywhere else. This article will probably be cited many times by me in my own writing, and that only goes to show how much this matters.
