            Here's my recipe for a homemade alfredo sauce. This can be done pretty quickly if you manage things correctly and are able to multitask without burning the sauce.
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>

            When I make this recipe, I use:
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound of dry pasta, usually a penne, rigato, or rotini (tri-color rotini is my favorite).</li>
                <li>1 can of condensed/evaporated milk (I use both an don't notice a significant difference from the sugar).</li>
                <li>A large amount of parmesean (couple handfuls? this depends on how thick you want the sauce).</li>
                <li>A teaspoon or two each of butter and flour (have more on hand when cooking the roux).</li>
                <li>Pepper (lots), garlic powder (a good amount), onion powder (not as much as the garlic powder), and salt (a small pinch, probably unnecessary).</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>

            If your parmesean isn't grated, grate it beforehand. Have all the ingredients near you as things can burn pretty quickly without being stirred. Open the can of milk before starting to cook!

            <br/>
            <h3>Cooking</h3>

            Start by boiling the water for the pasta. Then, take a saucepan and add the butter and the flour to make a roux. The pan should be on pretty high heat, and the butter and flour should mix in such a way that it's in between grainy and runny, ie. a very thick fluid. Add more flour or butter as necessary to achieve this consistency, then cook the roux until it smells more like butter than flour. It should stay pretty yellow.<br/>
            Then, add the can of condensed/evaporated milk. I sometimes add a little cream. You can do this with milk and heavy cream, but I find it takes longer to cook down, and I like the sauce very thick. Stir well using a whisk, making sure to scrape the bottom regularly so nothing burns. You will need to stir this near-constantly throughout. You can turn the heat down (I typically cook the roux on 9, and then bring the sauce down to about a 7). It should be lightly boiling when left unstirred for a few seconds. Once the milk is hot add the parm and stir. If it doesn't dissolve immediately keep stirring, it'll get there in due time.<br/>
            </br>
            <b>MAKE SURE TO KEEP STIRRING AND SCRAPING THE BOTTOM!!</b>
            <br/>
            At this point I add my spices. The sauce will thicken up a lot when you add the parm, but it'll take a few minutes to get to the very thick. If you don't want it thick, then don't add as much parm, or perhaps don't cook it down so much.
            <br/>
            
            <h3>Serving</h3>

            Drain the pasta into a colander, then put the pasta back into the pot it came from, pour the sauce over it, and mix. You can then dump it into the bowl.<br/>
            I like to grind an extra amount of parm and pepper on top for presentation's sake.
