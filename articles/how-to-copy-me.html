           <h2>Setting up the Server</h2>

           Watch <a id="clickable" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWAqilIVNgE" target="_blank">Luke Smith's video</a> on setting up the server. He's got at least two of these, and there's plenty of other resources, but I like the simplicity of this video.
           I use Linode and Epik at Luke's recommendation. There are probably other options that are just as good, and if you can find a good deal then take it. Just be wary of what happens to your rates <i>after</i> your discount expires!

           <h2>Building the Website</h2>

           My website's root directory is <code>/var/www/wrz/</code>, and in there I have <code>index.html</code>, <code>bookshelf.html</code> and the <code>articles/</code> folder; the <code>articles/</code> folder has its own <code>index.html</code> and all the articles listed in one folder.
           If you want your website to be as simple as mine, <b>take all the code from my website and put it on your server</b>. I make no copyright claim to the basic HTML and CSS that makes this stuff up; I'd appreciate if you credited me, but I won't come for you if you don't, so do what you want!

           <h2>Maintaining your Website</h2>

           Much like owning land, owning a website comes with maintenance obligations. Servers are typically charged monthly, and domain registrations charged yearly, though anybody with a job can <i>hopefully</i> afford to maintain them. If you can't pay your server costs, make sure you keep a backup; I like to push all of the contents of my website onto GitHub every once in a while. This is so that if you do regain the means to keep your stuff up, you can get it back running quickly.
           What you post on your website is up to you; the only people regulating you are probably your server host and the Feds, and server hosts <i>generally</i> tend to only take stuff down when the Feds order them to. This is different in different countries. I like to post articles occasionally, or stuff about myself like my bookshelf. Throw some details into it, spend some time collecting funny gifs, mess with the colors. I use my web server as a file server sometimes. I even have <a id="clickable" href="https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/index.html" target="_blank">an entirely separate website hosted on this same server and domain</a> that I built for a mock US government simulator; feel free to take the code from there too, especially the drop-down boxes.<br/>
           The point <i>is</i> to do what you want! You don't have to tell your employer, or anyone in your real life what you post or even that you post on your own website, hopefully.
