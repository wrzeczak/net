            I recently graduated high school this past Thursday, and as such my daily practice routine has been somewhat disrupted. For my junior and senior years, I would arrive at the school at about 7:15am (school started at 8:20am), set up in our "bass trombone foyer" which has been occupied by the bass trombones for the last 10 years, and then practice for 45min to an hour every morning. I made the Texas All-State Band twice doing this, and while I'm not studying music (perhaps I'll minor in trombone performance), I will continue playing and as such want to maintain and improve my skills on my instrument. Here is what I'm going to do this summer to achieve this goal.

            Some notes on notation; in the short packet, double barlines indicate generally that you should continue this exercise up or down chromatically until the endpoint notated (exercises B-F, I, and L). In exercise J, you should instead follow a major scale up and down for one octave. The long version of the packet has every exercise using double barlines written out in full, and with slide positions and valve indications. Numbers below notes mean that exercise should be performed in that position, numbered 1-7; + and - indicate a slight sharpening or flattening of the position, respectively. This notation is slightly ambiguous (for instance, F and Db in &Pi; and &Gamma; are both notated 3+ though they are not in the same place), but it's easy to read so it's what I went with. 0 (or no indication) indicates that no valves should be pressed down, V indiciates the first/thumb valve, &Pi; indicates the second/side valve, and &Gamma; indicates both valves. As with all things, do what your teacher tells you do to over what I've written regarding these exercises, in terms of positions and valve indications. I've only written what I've written as a default because it's what I do, and what your teacher tells you should take precedence.<br/><br/>
            The short version of the packet is two pages; my advice is to play the first page (exercises A-F) in order. I like to buzz on my mouthpiece for about 30 seconds before playing exercise A. Generally, all of these exercises should be performed with solid air, but not necessarily loudly. These are warm-ups, after all. The second page can be played out of order, though I think the order given is good for maintaining a relatively fresh face. Feel free to play some low tones to cool down in between the high stuff; I rep exercises A and E for this purpose. After playing through this packet, I'm playing one Rochut or Gillis book etude, just to make sure I'm playing music everyday as much as I'm working on technique; you can find any number of great etude books online or get them from your teacher.<br/><br/><br/>
            Some comments on individual exercises:<br><br/>
            Exercise G should start on Bb (if you can't hit high Bb, start on F), go up to the highest Bb, and then down to the lowest Bb, diatonically. Feel free to replace the major scale with another one. You should then transpose up chromatically (ie. Bb, B, C, C#). My current limit is tenatively D, so every day I shoot for high Eb, with my goal for this summer being able to hit a double high F consistently. Don't overstress yourself doing this exercise, but at the same time you should be pushing your limits every day.<br/><br/>
            Exercise H should go both up and down (ie. Bb, B, C# and Bb, A, Ab). I typically alternate going up one day and down another, though if you have time I'd do both (start with down first to cool down if you just finished playing exercise G).<br/><br/>
            The tonguing exercises I, J, and K should be performed with a metronome and performed both single and double tongued. The tempo should be such that you have to really focus to not start skipping notes. I'm starting at 95bpm and my goal is 120bpm by the end of the summer, both single and double tongued; my tongue technique is the weakest part of my playing, so you can probably double tongue faster, and if you can you should set a higher goal. Perform exercise I on at least 3 different partials. Perform exercise J in at least 3 key areas, and feel free to replace the major scale with another. Perform exercise K across one octave, and feel free to start on a low F or pedal Bb, or to start higher; I wrote it in the middle range because that's where we tend to tongue fast the most, but working on tonguing in the extended range will help in the middle range and be useful for when some crazy composer wants you to rip it elsewhere.<br/><br/>
            Exercise L is a warm-down exercise, and if you have one you prefer, do that instead or as well.<br/><br/><br/>
            If you have questions or comments on the packet, feel free to email me at wrzeczak@protonmail.com. I'm not a professional teacher by any means, but my teachers are excellent, and I'll be sure to forward your questions to them if I can't answer them myself.
