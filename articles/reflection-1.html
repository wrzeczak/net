            <b>How much of a fool was I to not recognize unconditional love?</b> To fail to recognize myself, as someone unloveable, who yet still was; someone who was yet still loved by someone more beautiful than him, by someone entirely beautiful!<br/><br/>
            "How is reality? How has it pleased you?" Has living in the face of love I rejected with no basis (as if there could be such a basis! For spirit to reject an answer is unthinkable.) pleased me, or has it brought me to profane realizations, profane ideology, i.e. to the bullshit I spew everyday. What has it brought me but disgust? It is always an awful moment when something unloved intrudes upon something loved.<br/><br/>
            My only prayer is that I did not kill her like Yasuko, and perhaps Kyoko, were so brutally slain. This is the only thing that I can motivate myself to prayer with, by my faith in sensuality.<br/><br/>
            Was a fool I was&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;"all we did was fuck"&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; as if I should have wished for love without lust? It is as if I had wished to live life permanently choking.<br/><br/>
            I think I loved her like I only should have loved a man; with camraderie, with beauty, carnality. My confusion was through these crossed wires. I look at every other woman I "love" and I wish with all my heart that she were a man. She was my only friend, and that was among her greatest strengths, in her infinite power. That I could love her as Socrates loved his boyfriends, and his friends (that is, one and the same) was truly remarkable. It was remarkable that I could <i>know</i> her in lust. It was remarkable that she did this in the fullness of her femininity, and that by my love for her in a masculine context, she extended herself to the fullest reaches of humanity. She was more human than I, living in the breadth of masculinity and femininity.<br/><br/>
            Even if it were true that she did not know me, what should it have mattered? Do I even love me? I can barely say I do. In her beauty, vitality, in all her strength, she could do both.
