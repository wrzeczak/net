            <b>The Bookshelf</b><br/>
        </div>

        My collection of books, sorted by category, and mentioned generally by how much I've read of them; I've also made note of my general thoughts on each book, if I've read it, and how much of it I've gotten through if I haven't finished.
        <br/><br/>
        One thing to note is that much of the reading I did as a child (ie. prior to about 8th grade) was done a Kindle Paperwhite, whose books I'm not going to cite because of the sheer volume of material stored on that thing. I make note in the addendum after the fiction section some of the stuff I read as a kid.

        <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
        <span id="left"><b>The C Programming Language</b></span> <span id="right">Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie</span> <br/>
        <i>I recieved this book for Christmas when I was in the eighth grade, and have read it twice all the way through since then. Very useful for someone who understands basic programming principles to learn the language and the simplicity of it.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Twentieth-Century Harmony</b></span> <span id="right">Vincent Persichetti</span> <br/>
        <i>Purchased this book in eighth grade on the recommendation of Adam Neely. "Read" it once through, but it didn't particularly captivate me at the time (mostly because I wasn't nearly advanced enough a composer to make use of it), so it didn't really stick with me. I intend to reread it soon, now that I think I'm good enough with the pen to gain useful knowledge from it.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</b></span> <span id="right">Malcolm X and Alex Haley</span> <br/>
        <i>Read this book during "SSR" time in sophomore English. Very interesting look into his life, and one of the first motivators for myself to return to Christianity after an epoch in my life of lukewarm half-willed atheism. Islam didn't appeal to me as I saw it as a worldly religion, so I instead turned to my native Catholicism. Would recommend to anyone.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Gulag Archipelago</b></span> <span id="right">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</span> <br/>
        <i>Probably my second favorite book. I purchased this after Christmas 2022, while we were stuck in St. Louis after our alternator died AND the car was broken into. We were strolling through a mall and the title caught my eye. I read the back 2/3rds and finished the text while on a 3-week vacation in Alaska in the summer of 2023. One of the most powerful books I've ever read, especially when placed in the Alaskan scenery, which much of Asian Russia, minus the mountainous terrian, perhaps, mimics. Would recommend to anybody with a strong stomach.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</b></span> <span id="right">Frederick Douglass</span> <br/>
        <i>This book was assigned reading in junior English. Much like the Archipelago, an excellent look into not only the physical but the mental conditions and tortures American slaves went through. If you didn't read it in high school (or even if you did...), I'd recommend it. Also like the Archipelago, it's at times brutal and gory, but that's an absolutely essential quality of the work.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Moscow, December 25th, 1991</b></span> <span id="right">Connor O'Clery</span> <br/>
        <i>I don't remember when I got this book (as a class of 2024 kid, time between late eighth grade and sophomore year is fuzzy), but it was a good read for the history buff kid I was.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Rock and Sand</b></span> <span id="right">Archpriest Josiah B. Trenham</span> <br/>
        <i>A book describing the Orthodox perspective on the Protestant reformers that I have been absolutely devouring. Fascinsating look at the complex history of the different branches of theology within Protestantism, and a concise and unbiased description at that. The relation of the Orthodox perspective is simple and easy to read for the un-catechized. Highly recommended.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Medicinal Plants of the American Southwest</b></span> <span id="right">Charles W. Kane</span> <br/>
        <i>Bought this book in Big Bend probably in freshman or sophomore year. I can't speak to its efficacy as a medical tome, as I've never had to use it, but it was a good guide for field identification and gave some cool info about the plants of the region, especially regarding what lies underground that we don't often see.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Small-Scale Grain Raising</b></span> <span id="right">Gene Logdson</span> <br/>
        <i>Got this book and planted my wheat in the summer of 2022. All went well until I went away for a band competition for a few days and came back to all the green wheat logded. Would recommend to anyone looking into growing wheat for yourself, just make sure you keep a better eye on it than I did.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Time's Echo</b></span> <span id="right">Jeremy Eichler</span> <br/>
        <i>My father got me this book a few months ago (ie. early 2024) and it's one I'm currently reading. Very interesting to anyone who's into modern so-called-classical music like I am, especially if you're as much of a fan of Shostakovich.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Cadillac Desert</b></span> <span id="right">Marc Reisner</span> <br/>
        <i>Picked this up last time I was in Big Bend. I've gotten through the introduction and first two chapters, and it is excellent, very well-written and informative so far.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <h2>Theology</h2>

        <span id="left"><b>The Orthodox Study Bible</b></span> <span id="right">St. Athanasius Academy</span> <br/>
        <i>A very well put-together study Bible and my personal copy in English. Good to have for anyone even so much as inquiring into the Orthodox Church.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Death to the World</b></span> <span id="right">All Issues</span> <br/>
        <i>I've got physical copies of issues 1, 2 and 6, and I'd like to collect them all, but they're variable in print. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to learn about Orthodox sprituality and some fascinating stories of the saints and martyrs.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>God's Revelation to the Human Heart</b></span> <span id="right">Friar Seraphim Rose</span> <br/>
        <i>This is a short book that's a transcription of a speech Fr. Rose gave at USC. It gives a very good retelling of the most foundational notions of Orthodox Christianity; if you find yourself or anyone else asking "What is Orthodoxy about?," this is the book to read. I've been through it at least twice myself.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Orthodox Dogmatic Theology</b></span> <span id="right">Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky</span> <br/>
        <i>I've gotten through about half of this book so far. Very good starting point for anyone interested in basic Orthodox dogmatics. I will note this book assumes faith in its teaching, as its original intention was to be for men training to be Orthodox preachers; it's absolutely accessible to any layman, but it doesn't tackle the question of faith in the Gospel, and takes it as granted.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Catechism of the Catholic Church</b></span> <span id="right">Second Edition</span> <br/>
        <i>I find it preferable to have a physical reference copy around of the Catechism in my research. I would recommend against trying to read it straight through, it is an absolute slog.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>The Soul After Death</b></span> <span id="right">Friar Seraphim Rose</span> <br/>
        <i>I haven't yet cracked this one open, but it comes highly recommended by many Orthodox faithful I've spoken to, as do all of Fr. Rose's works.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Marriage and Virginity, According to St. John Chrysostom</b></span> <span id="right">Archpriest Josiah B. Trenham</span> <br/>
        <i>I haven't read this one yet.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Christianity and the State</b></span> <span id="right">Archbishop William Temple</span> <br/>
        <i>I've listed this in theology rather than philosophy for no particular reason. I haven't gotten through a third of this book, but it's rather interesting so far, and seems to paint largely in line with the Catholic social teaching of the later Popes in regards to governance and the economy and such.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <span id="left"><b>The Genealogy of Morals</b></span> <span id="right">Friedrich Nietzsche trans. Douglas Smith</span> <br/>
        <i>Read this towards the end of my junior year and it was my first foray into Nietzsche and my first real foray into philosophy. A great book to read if you're at all interested in Nietzsche.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Stranger</b></span> <span id="right">Albert Camus</span> <br/>
        <i>I put this in philosophy because this was my first exposure to the absurd nature of life. This is the most emotionally powerful book I've ever read, especially at the end; I read the first half in one sitting, and most of the second half in another, but I couldn't physically bring myself to finish it at that time and had to wait a couple days. Highly recommended, and if I had to list it I'd probably put it at number three.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>Beyond Good and Evil</b></span> <span id="right">Friedrich Nietzsche trans. Kaufmann</span> <br/>
        <i>I've read 3 of the 4 sections of this book, and it's a fascinating read; I'd certainly recommend a reader to try the Genealogy first, because this book is a long-form expansion of all of the ideas within it.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Either/Or</b></span> <span id="right">SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard</span> <br/>
        <i>Though I haven't gotted through much of this book, I've informed myself extensively about it and its philosophy, and it's one I've really taken to heart as a sort of neo-Romantic myself. The best lectures on the subject are by the late <a id="clickable" href="https://www.youtube.com/@dr.michaelsugrue">Professor Michael Sugrue</a>, by the way.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Myth of Sisyphus</b></span> <span id="right">Albert Camus</span> <br/>
        <i>Unlike </i>The Stranger<i> this one is unfortunately rather dry in the beginning, at least to me. His discussion of why people kill themselves isn't all that interesting to me, mostly because it doesn't accurately reflect my own experience with suicidal ideation throughout my recent years. I'm sure it's a great book! Just not for me, I've never questioned suicide.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        Philosophy books that I own but haven't read into at all include:<br/>
        <span id="left"><b>Process and Reality</b></span> <span id="right">Alfred Whitehead</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Rebel</b></span> <span id="right">Albert Camus</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Republic</b></span> <span id="right">Plato</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Three Criticisms</b></span> <span id="right">Immanuel Kant</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>Man and Action</b></span> <span id="right">Karol WojtyÅ‚a</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Enchantments of Mammon</b></span> <span id="right">Eugene McCarraher</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</b></span> <span id="right">Max Weber</span> <br/>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Fiction</h2>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Egyptian</b></span> <span id="right">Mika Waltari</span> <br/>
        <i>This is my all-time favorite book. My father got me it when I was still in middle school or maybe late elementary school. I've read it at least twice all the way through and it was the best work of fiction I've ever read. I will not comment on what it means for my childhood's defining text to have been historical fiction about Akhenaten's rule of Ancient Egypt. Highyl recommended to everybody, everywhere, at all times.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch</b></span> <span id="right">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</span> <br/>
        <i>This was the first book of Solzhenitsyn's I read, at the recommendation of my father in eighth grade. Excellent work and story, it may seem over-wrought, but read it with the intention of learning the mental state of this character, and really setting yourself into his misery, just as Solzehnitsyn does in the Archipelago, where his focus is often on the cultural ramifications of guÅ‚ag rather than just its sheer brutality.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Odyssey</b></span> <span id="right">Homer</span> <br/>
        <i>I've never actually read this book, rather it was read to me by my father when I was in the first and second grade. A beautiful story which I intend to re-read soon, as the memory of a six-year-old who's on the verge of falling asleep (not because of the story, though!) is perhaps a little paltry.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>The Great Gatsby</b></span> <span id="right">F. Scott Fitzgerald</span> <br/>
        <i>This was required reading in junior English, and it was a great read (as were all the books in that class, I had an excellent teacher).</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <span id="left"><b>White Nights</b></span> <span id="right">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</span> <br/>
        <i>Picked this up after I picked up Karamazov, but it's an excellent primer to Dostoyevsky if you ever want to start (and you should!).</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>The Brothers Karamazov</b></span> <span id="right">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</span> <br/>
        <i>I went through a reading slump, especially with ficiton, from eighth grade until about senior year, and this was the first fiction book to really keep my attention; Dostoyevsky is just that good. At time of writing I'm about 630/800-ish pages deep and still loving it.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <span id="left"><b>Forbidden Colors</b></span> <span id="right">Yukio Mishima</span> <br/>
        <i>Have only read a little into it but already hooked; fascinating halfway-autobiographical piece.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        
        Fiction books I have but haven't read into at all include:<br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Divine Comedy</b></span> <span id="right">Dante Alighieri</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>Pan Tadeusz</b></span> <span id="right">Adam Mickiewicz trans. Mackenzie</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>The Idiot</b></span> <span id="right">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>With Fire and Sword</b></span> <span id="right">Kenryk Sienkiewicz</span> <br/>
        <span id="left"><b>Paradise Lost</b></span> <span id="right">John Milton</span> <br/>
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Addendum</b><br/>
        When I was a child I read a ton of fiction, a lot of which I've probably forgotten or has melted together in my mind. In my earlier youth (kindergarten through elementary school) I was more into the typical fantasy stuff, but also had somewhat of a proclivity for classics, no doubt spawned by my father's reading of the Odyssey to me. I read all of the Harry Potter books (before the Cursed Child came out, never read that one), the whole Percy Jackson series (at the time), a good chunk of The Hitchiker's Guide, as well as Moby Dick.
        As I grew older (middle school, maybe 5th grade too) I moved towards darker material; I read a lot of dystopias, not only 1984 but Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and at least one other one, though I can't remember its title. I was also really into Kurt Vonnegut and read probably most of his shorter novels, though they've all melted together in my head by now. Fiction wasn't all I read; as a kid I was really into quantum physics, banal as that sounds, and read a lot of material about it, though without an understanding of the math behind it I mostly just came away with a solid grasp on the consequences of quantum theory. I was also a total history buff as a kid, and so I read a lot of that stuff too.<br/>
        If you're putting a kid on I'd definitely give them Kurt Vonnegut, The Egyptian, Harry Potter, Fahrenheit 451 (1984 and Brave New World are pretty heady, but I handled it fine as a kid, so...), and if they're into mythology then Percy Jackson as well. Let them read that stuff before they get old and find it cringe-worthy (though I'd never decry Vonnegut and The Egyptian myself). Kids should be reading kid stuff! Showing them the great classics and works for more mature audiences than them is great if they're ready for them like I was, but I still read plenty of kid stuff too, and that was good for me. If the kid isn't ready for more mature stuff, I'd first say try giving it to them, because we tend to underestimate children, but if they don't get it then don't fret about it, and let them keep reading Harry Potter.
